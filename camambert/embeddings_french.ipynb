        "# Exploring Camembert for French Text Difficulty Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will explore the use of Camembert, a popular pre-trained language model for the French language, to tackle the task of classifying French text difficulty. Text difficulty classification is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task that has various applications, such as educational content assessment, language learning, and content recommendation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Camembert is a transformer-based language model, and it has demonstrated impressive performance on various NLP tasks in the French language. Leveraging its pre-trained representations, we will train and evaluate a model to predict the difficulty level of French texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Our approach will involve the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation**: We will load and preprocess the dataset, including text tokenization, data splitting, and any necessary data augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Selection**: We will fine-tune a Camembert model for our text difficulty classification task. Fine-tuning involves adapting the pre-trained model to our specific task by training it on our labeled dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Training**: We will train the Camembert-based model on the training data and monitor its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Evaluation**: After training, we will evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation or test dataset. We will assess its accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and any other relevant metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Inference**: We will demonstrate how to use the trained model to predict the difficulty level of new, unseen French texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Analysis and Interpretation**: We will analyze the model's predictions, inspect its behavior, and identify potential areas for improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we begin, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python 3.x\n",
        "- PyTorch\n",
        "- Transformers library (Hugging Face Transformers)\n",
        "- Scikit-learn\n",
        "- Matplotlib (for data visualization)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can install these libraries using `pip` or `conda` as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's get started with data loading and preparation!"

        "\n",
        "This code snippet involves a function that uses a BERT model to generate embeddings from text:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Importing PyTorch:**\n",
        "   - `import torch`: This line imports the PyTorch library, which is a popular framework for deep learning and is commonly used for tasks involving neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Function to Get BERT Embeddings:**\n",
        "   - `def get_bert_embeddings(text): ...`: This function, `get_bert_embeddings`, takes a string `text` as input and returns its embedding generated by a BERT model.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Tokenizing and Encoding Text:**\n",
        "   - `encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', padding=\"max_length\", max_length=512, truncation=True)`: \n",
        "     - The text is tokenized and encoded using a tokenizer compatible with a BERT model. \n",
        "     - `return_tensors='pt'` indicates that the output will be PyTorch tensors.\n",
        "     - `padding=\"max_length\"` and `max_length=512` ensure that all encoded texts are padded or truncated to the same length for batch processing.\n",
        "     - `truncation=True` allows the tokenizer to truncate texts longer than the maximum length.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Moving Encoded Input to CUDA:**\n",
        "   - `encoded_input = {key: value.to('cuda') for key, value in encoded_input.items()}`: \n",
        "     - This line moves the encoded input to a CUDA-enabled device (typically a GPU) for faster processing. \n",
        "     - This is necessary for leveraging GPU acceleration during model inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Inference Without Gradient Calculation:**\n",
        "   - `with torch.no_grad(): ...`: \n",
        "     - This context manager tells PyTorch not to calculate gradients during the following operations, which is standard practice during inference to reduce memory usage and computation.\n",

        "   - `return output.hidden_states[-1].mean(dim=1).squeeze().cpu().numpy()`: \n",
        "     - The function returns the mean-pooled vector of the last layer's hidden states.\n",
        "     - `output.hidden_states[-1]` accesses the last layer's hidden states.\n",
        "     - `.mean(dim=1)` computes the mean across the sequence dimension, effectively pooling the embeddings.\n",
        "     - `.squeeze()` removes any singleton dimensions.\n",
        "     - `.cpu().numpy()` moves the tensor back to the CPU and converts it to a NumPy array, making it compatible with libraries like scikit-learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "This function is typically used to convert text into a dense numerical representation, capturing linguistic features as understood by the BERT model, and can be used for various downstream machine learning or NLP tasks.\n"

        "\n",
        "5. **Reshaping and Assigning Embeddings to DataFrame:**\n",
        "   - `flattened_embeddings = embeddings.reshape((len(df), -1))`: \n",
        "     - The embeddings array is reshaped to have a shape of `(len(df), -1)`. \n",

        "   - `words = text.split()`: Splits the text into words.\n",

        "     - Applies `sentence_features` to the 'text' column in DataFrame `df`.\n",

This is a standard practice in machine learning to normalize data within a specific range, typically 0 to 1, which can enhance the performance of many algorithms.\n",

This method aims to find the optimal settings for the SVM model by testing different combinations and evaluating their performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "This code snippet is focused on building and configuring a deep learning model using Keras, a high-level neural networks API:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Import Statements:**\n",
        "   - The snippet starts by importing necessary components from Keras such as `Sequential`, `Embedding`, `Dense`, `Conv1D`, `MaxPooling1D`, `GlobalMaxPooling1D`, and various others. These are key building blocks for constructing neural network layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Setting Up Callbacks:**\n",
        "   - `callback_list` is defined with three types of callbacks: `EarlyStopping` (to stop training when the accuracy metric stops improving), `ModelCheckpoint` (to save the model after every epoch where the validation loss improves), and `ReduceLROnPlateau` (to reduce the learning rate when a metric has stopped improving). These callbacks help in optimizing the training process and preventing overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Building the Model:**\n",
        "   - The model is built using a functional API approach. \n",
        "   - It starts with defining an input layer `text_input_layer`.\n",
        "   - Several convolutional layers (`Conv1D`) followed by max-pooling layers (`MaxPooling1D`) are added. This structure is common in processing sequential data (like text) where local patterns are important.\n",
        "   - After multiple convolution and pooling layers, a `GlobalMaxPooling1D` layer is used to downsample the entire feature map to a single vector per map.\n",
        "   - This is followed by a dense layer with ReLU activation and an output layer with softmax activation (for multi-class classification, as indicated by 6 units in the output layer).\n",
        "   - The model is then compiled with the RMSprop optimizer, categorical crossentropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Summary and Compilation:**\n",
        "   - `model.summary()` provides a summary of the model's architecture.\n",
        "   - The model is compiled with specific settings for the optimizer (learning rate), loss function, and metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code is typical for building a convolutional neural network for tasks like text or sequence classification, showcasing the flexibility and ease of using Keras for deep learning tasks.\n"

        "\n",
        "1. **POS Tagging Function:**\n",
        "   - `def get_pos_tags(text): ...`: A function is defined to get the POS tags for a given text.\n",
        "   - `doc = nlp(text)`: Processes the text using an NLP model (likely from a library like spaCy) to tokenize the text and assign POS tags.\n",
        "   - `return [token.pos_ for token in doc]`: Returns a list of POS tags for each token in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Applying POS Tagging to DataFrame:**\n",
        "   - `df['pos_tags'] = df['text'].apply(get_pos_tags)`: Applies the `get_pos_tags` function to each row in the 'text' column of a DataFrame `df`, creating a new column 'pos_tags' that contains the list of POS tags for each text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Extracting Unique POS Tags:**\n",
        "   - `all_pos_tags = set(tag for tags in data['pos_tags'] for tag in tags)`: Extracts all unique POS tags present in the DataFrame. This set represents all different POS tags encountered across the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Creating One-Hot Encoded Vectors:**\n",
        "   - The code initializes an empty list `one_hot_vectors` to store one-hot encoded vectors.\n",
        "   - For each list of tags in `df['pos_tags']`, it creates a one-hot encoded vector where each element corresponds to a tag in `all_pos_tags`. If the tag is present in the list, the element is 1; otherwise, it is 0.\n",
        "   - These vectors represent the presence or absence of each POS tag in each text and are appended to `one_hot_vectors`.\n",
        "\n",

        "This code snippet demonstrates the integration of NLP features into a DataFrame and processes text data in batches to generate embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Creating DataFrame from One-Hot Vectors:**\n",
        "   - `pos_tags_df = pd.DataFrame(one_hot_vectors, columns=list(all_pos_tags))`: Converts the list of one-hot encoded vectors (created earlier for POS tags) into a Pandas DataFrame. Each column represents a unique POS tag.\n",

        "2. **Concatenating DataFrames:**\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Batch Processing for Embedding Generation:**\n",
        "   - `batch_size=8`: Sets the size of each batch for processing.\n",
        "   - `text_batches = [df['text'][i:i + batch_size]...`: Splits the 'text' column of `df` into smaller batches. Each batch contains `batch_size` texts.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Concatenating and Reshaping Embeddings:**\n",
        "   - `embeddings = np.concatenate(embeddings)`: Concatenates all embeddings into a single NumPy array.\n",
        "   - `flattened_embeddings = embeddings.reshape((len(df), -1))`: Reshapes the embeddings so that there's one embedding vector per text entry in the DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Assigning Embeddings to DataFrame:**\n",
        "   - The final loop iterates over each dimension of the `flattened_embeddings` and assigns each to a new column in the DataFrame `df`. The columns are named `embed_0`, `embed_1`, etc., storing different dimensions of the embedding vectors for each text.\n",
        "\n",
